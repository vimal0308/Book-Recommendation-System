This Book Recommendation System leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest books to users based on their preferences. It includes a Flask-based web interface where users can input their favorite book, and the system recommends similar titles. The project utilizes a pre-trained model and datasets for efficient book similarity calculations. The code is written in Python, with dependencies on pandas, NumPy, and Flask.
